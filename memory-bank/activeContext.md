# Vikunja MCP Server Active Context

## Current Status

### Focus Areas

1. API client implementation
2. HTTP client setup and configuration
3. Error handling and validation
4. Test coverage for API interactions

### Recent Decisions

1. Using TypeScript with strict mode for type safety
2. Test-driven development approach
3. Feature-focused architecture with clear separation of concerns
4. Using MCP TypeScript SDK for server implementation
5. Configuration system with Zod validation
6. Jest with silent reporter for testing

### Next Steps

1. Design API client interface with TypeScript types
2. Setup HTTP client with axios
3. Implement error handling and response normalization
4. Create API client tests with MSW

## Active Considerations

### Technical Design

1. Resource URI patterns and entity modeling
2. Tool interface design for CRUD operations
3. API client architecture and error handling
4. Rate limiting and request throttling

### Implementation Strategy

1. Type-first development for API client
2. Test-driven implementation with MSW
3. Error handling and recovery patterns
4. Request/response transformation

### Open Questions

1. Rate limiting implementation details
2. Error recovery strategies
3. Request retry policies
4. Response caching approach
