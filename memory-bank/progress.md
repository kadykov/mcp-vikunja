- Configuration tests implemented and passing
- OpenAPI type generation implemented
  - Script created using swagger2openapi and openapi-typescript
  - Type definitions generated and exported
  - Clean type export API through src/types/index.ts
  - Documentation added for type generation and usage
- Runtime type validation implemented
  - Custom ValidationError class for error handling
  - Zod schemas for API types
  - Task and User validation with tests
  - Comprehensive test coverage for validation system
- MSW testing infrastructure implemented
  - Type-safe request handlers using OpenAPI types
  - Test data factories with proper type integration
  - Test utilities with error handling
  - Example tests for Project and Task APIs
  - Comprehensive documentation for test setup

## Current Status

- Configuration system completed
- OpenAPI type generation implemented and working
- Runtime type validation system implemented
- MSW testing infrastructure completed and documented
  - Success/error response patterns established
  - Test structure patterns defined
  - Type-safe request/response handling
- HTTP client layer implemented with MSW tests
  - Core request handling complete
  - Basic error handling patterns established
  - Project and Task CRUD operations tested
  - Next phases identified:
    1. Reference implementation review
    2. Integration testing with local Vikunja
    3. Optional features (rate limiting, retry policies)

## Known Issues

None

## Next Milestone

HTTP Client Layer Integration Testing

- Target: Fully tested HTTP client verified against real Vikunja API
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: Local Vikunja instance, Reference implementations review
- Next Steps:
  1. Review reference implementations in local-docs/ for patterns
  2. Set up local Vikunja instance using Docker
  3. Create test automation for user/token setup
  4. Implement integration tests
  5. Plan optional features implementation
