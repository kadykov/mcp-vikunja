## Current Status

Implementing final MCP server features:

1. Testing Infrastructure (Complete)

   - Created MCP test helpers
     - Server startup and cleanup
     - Test user management through Vikunja API
     - Test project creation and cleanup
   - Updated E2E tests for real data validation
   - Integrated with existing test infrastructure
   - Successfully running against real Vikunja instance

2. Resource Handler Integration (In Progress)
   - Project resource class connected and tested
   - Environment-based configuration working
   - Basic error handling implemented
   - Need to add performance monitoring and rate limiting

## Next Steps:

1. Improve Server Robustness:

   - Add rate limiting implementation
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Implement comprehensive logging

2. Start documentation phase:
   - Document test setup requirements
   - Add examples for test data management
   - Document configuration options
   - Create contribution guidelines
