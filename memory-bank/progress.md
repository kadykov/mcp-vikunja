## Current Status

- Configuration system completed
- OpenAPI type generation implemented and working
- Runtime type validation system implemented
- MSW testing infrastructure completed and documented
- Ready to implement HTTP client layer
- Test infrastructure working

## Known Issues

None

## Next Milestone

HTTP Client Layer Implementation

- Target: Working HTTP client with proper types and validation
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: Configuration system, Type definitions, Validation system, MSW test infrastructure
- Next Steps:
  1. Implement HTTP client using MSW tests as contract
  2. Add error handling using established patterns
  3. Integrate with configuration system
  4. Add integration tests
