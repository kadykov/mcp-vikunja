## Current Status

Phase 3 in progress - Resource Layer Implementation & Testing

Key achievements:

- Base resource layer design and implementation completed
- Project resource implementation with full CRUD support
- Task resource implementation with full CRUD support
- Unit test infrastructure successfully reused
- Integration test infrastructure established
- Project and Task resource integration tests implemented
- Direct API response handling implemented
- Project_id validation added to Task resource
- Testing structure optimized (removed example and HTTP layer tests)

## Next Steps:

1. Implement more comprehensive error case testing
2. Add pagination support to list operations
3. Implement query parameter handling
4. Begin implementing additional resources (Labels, Comments)
5. Document testing patterns and best practices
6. Consider cleanup strategy for integration test data
